# ForemanSubnetsWithBGPConfig

Add fields for BGP relevant configuration settings to the Foreman Subnet model.

## Installation

See [How_to_Install_a_Plugin](https://www.theforeman.org/plugins/#2.Installation)
for how to install Foreman plugins in general. The following should be sufficient.

1. Ensure Foreman will load the plugin by adding it to its bundler Gems collection
    ```bash
    echo 'gem "foreman_subnets_with_bgp_config"' >~foreman/bundler.d/foreman_subnets_with_bgp_config.rb
    chown foreman: ~foreman/bundler.d/foreman_subnets_with_bgp_config.rb
    ```
1. Produce the plugin Gem from a recent clone of the source Git repository
    ```bash
    git clone git@githut.com:foreman-plugins/foreman_subnets_with_bgp_config.git
    cd foreman_subnets_with_bgp_config
    gem build foreman_subnets_with_bgp_config.gemspec
    ```
1. Ensure no old versions of the plugin are installed
    ```bash
    gem uninstall foreman_subnets_with_bgp_config --version '>= 0'
    ```
1. Install the newly generated Gem **without dependencies**, in order to not replace any Gems used by Foreman
    ```bash
    gem install --ignore-dependencies foreman_subnets_with_bgp_config-*.gem
    /bin/rm foreman_subnets_with_bgp_config-*.gem # Cleanup to avoid future conflicts
    ```
1. If the plugin is installed for the first time, 
1. Foreman needs a restart with every newly installed Gem
    ```bash
    foreman-maintain service restart
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, the management form of Subnets should show additional
fields for setting Local-AS, Remote-AS and Remote-IP values.
